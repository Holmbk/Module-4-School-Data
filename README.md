# Module-4-School-Data

## Overview
School board found evidence that the Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have altered their math and reading grades.  Although the board does not know the extent of the dishonesty.  We are asked to replace the math and reading scores for the ninth grade at Thomas High School with NaNs, and then redue the school distric analysis.

## Results
### How is the Distric Summary Affected?
There is no significant difference between the scores with or without the ninth graders scores.  The difference shows in the charter school type two places to the right of the deciminal.
